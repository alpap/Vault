# Nexus

## Sonatype Nexus is a popular repository manager used for managing and organizing software components. It acts as a central hub for storing, sharing, and retrieving software libraries, artifacts, and binaries used in development and deployment processes. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the basics:

## Types of Nexus Repositories
Proxy Repositories: These act as a caching proxy for remote repositories (like Maven Central, npm registry, etc.). When you request an artifact, Nexus will download it from the remote source and cache it locally.
Hosted Repositories: These are local repositories where you can store your own internally developed artifacts.
Virtual Repositories (Repository Groups): These combine multiple repositories (proxy, hosted, or other groups) into a single repository, simplifying access to multiple sources.
## Supported Formats
Nexus supports a wide range of repository formats:

Maven (Java): Stores Java libraries (JAR files) following the Maven structure.
npm (Node.js): Manages Node.js packages.
NuGet (.NET): For .NET assemblies and libraries.
PyPI (Python): Manages Python packages.
Docker: Stores Docker images in private registries.
RubyGems (Ruby): Stores Ruby gems.
## Key Features
Artifact Storage: Nexus can store software packages and artifacts such as JARs, WARs, ZIPs, and other binaries.
Dependency Management: It helps in managing dependencies for builds, especially in Maven and Gradle-based projects.
Versioning: Nexus supports multiple versions of artifacts, making it easy to retrieve the correct version during builds.
Access Control: It provides fine-grained security with role-based access control (RBAC) for users and groups to manage who can publish, retrieve, or manage artifacts.
Search Capabilities: It includes search features for quickly locating artifacts based on various criteria (like name, version, etc.).
## Use Cases
Build Automation: Nexus integrates with build tools (like Jenkins, Maven, and Gradle) to store and retrieve dependencies during automated builds.
Caching Artifacts: By proxying external repositories, Nexus helps in speeding up builds and reducing external network dependency by caching dependencies locally.
Internal Package Sharing: Development teams can use Nexus to store and share their internal packages or libraries securely.
Release Management: It can handle the release of software versions, storing snapshots and released artifacts separately.
## Popular Versions
Nexus Repository OSS: The open-source version of Nexus with core repository management features.
Nexus Repository Pro: The paid version with additional features like advanced security, high availability, and support for more formats.
## Integration with DevOps
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Nexus integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient artifact handling during build and deployment phases.
Sonatype Nexus IQ: For more advanced security and quality scanning, Sonatype also offers Nexus IQ, which analyzes software components for known vulnerabilities and licensing issues.
## User Interface
Nexus provides an intuitive web-based user interface where you can:

Browse artifacts and metadata.
Manage repository configurations.
View download statistics.
Manage access controls and users.
In summary, Sonatype Nexus is a powerful tool for managing software artifacts, enhancing build efficiency, and ensuring secure and reliable access to software components in both development and production environments.
